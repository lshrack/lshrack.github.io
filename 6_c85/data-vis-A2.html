			<h2>Subtheme: Speculation</h2>
			<br />
			

			<ol>
				<li>
					How have trends in property sales changed over time, particularly with regards to investors? Is it possible to
					actually visualize the trends we've been talking about in class and that have been mentioned in some of the readings,
					where investors are crowding out the market?
				</li>
				<li>
					How do the different investor 'types' (count, value, LLC, and building) overlap? This question is primarily
					motivated by the first reading, which describes how investors are categorized based on the number, type, and value of
					properties that they buy, as well as whether or not they do so through an LLC. The article states that they're not
					mutually exclusive, so I'd be interested to see the relationship between these categories.
				</li>
				<li>
					Based on this dataset, do sales to investors appear to correlate with rises in prices? This seems to be what both
					of the readings for this subtheme suggest. To analyze this question, I'd be
					interested in analyzing how price difference varies based on investor type, and if there are observable
					price increases associated with investors.

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>
			<br />

			<h3>Initial Data Exploration</h3>

			<br />

			<h4>Sales Types</h4>
			<br />

			One of my first objectives in exploring the dataset was to understand which types of sales it included.
			To examine this, I used the usage and property type fields. The property type field appeared to be a
			supercategory of usage. For the purposes of my analysis, I wanted to determine which of these fields
			counted as housing. I decided on the following split:

			<br />
			<br />

			<ul>
				<li>
					RCD = housing - residential condos
				</li><li>
					R1F = housing - single-family homes
				</li><li>
					APT = housing - apartments
				</li><li>
					REO = housing - other residential, such as dorms and mixed use residential/commercial
				</li><li>
					R2F = housing - two-family homes
				</li><li>
					R3F = housing - three-family homes
				</li><li>
					R25 = housing - 2-5 family homes
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br />
			<ul>
				<li>
					COM = not housing - commercial
				</li><li>
					CNR = not housing - non-residential condos
				</li><li>
					EXM = not housing - churches, nonprofits, etc.
				</li><li>
					LND = not housing - land
				</li><li>
					IND = not housing - industrial
				</li><li>
					REC = not housing - recreational
				</li><li>
					OTH = not housing - other
				</li>
			</ul>

			<br />

			However, these categorizations do come with some caveats. For instance, it's not completely clear
			whether mixed use residential/commercial should be counted as residential. I chose to count it as
			residential since it includes housing and thus still seems relevant to an analysis of investor behavior.

			<br />

			<figure>
				<img class = "center-fit" src ="property_types_all.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Usage, colored by property type. Blue shades represent the property types considered housing, and
				orange shades represent those not considered housing.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			As is shown in this figure, the dataset overwhelmingly consists of condo sales. This makes it difficult
			to analyze patterns in the other housing types, so I chose to split condominium analysis from my analysis
			of other housing types in some of the following analysis.

			<br />
			<br />

			This also may be important because it's not completely clear whether rows labeled as "Condominium" are
			actually always residential condos. I did some preliminary analysis of this by looking at addresses for
			a few of the datapoints, but it was very difficult to tell with just a Google search whether these
			addresses were actually residential condos or one of the other condo types. Regardless, dividing condos
			from the rest of the data ensures that any error does not affect the rest of the analysis.

			<br />
			<br />

			I produced a second version of this figure with the RCD property type excluded, to make it easier to see
			the distribution of other property types and usages.

			<figure>
				<img class = "center-fit" src ="property_types_no_condo.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Usage, colored by property type, excluding the RCD property type. Blue shades represent the
				property types considered housing, and orange shades represent those not considered housing.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			This shows the relative distribution of housing types other than condos.

			<br />
			<br />

			<h4>Geography</h4>
			<br />

			I was next interested in understanding the geographic distribution of the dataset. To this end, I
			produced a simple map visualization of the number of transactions in each ZIP code. Once again, I split
			condos into a separate map. I also removed all non-housing property types, using the splitting
			described above.

			<br />
			

			<figure>
				<img class = "center-fit" src ="geographic_distr.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				These maps show the number of transactions in each ZIP code. The map on the left shows all housing
				types except for condos, while the one on the right only shows condos.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			We can see that the transactions seem to be concentrated toward the center part of the city, around the
			Back Bay area. There are also some geographic outliers, particularly in the condo transactions.

			<br />

			<br />

			<h4>Price</h4>
			<br />

			I next started looking at some of the numeric fields in the dataset, specifically the price-related ones.
			I started with a simple histogram of price across the transactions categorized as housing.

			<figure>
				<img class = "center-fit" src="price.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Price of transactions categorized as housing. Everything above $20M is filtered out, to make the graph
				readable; the trend of a long tail continues to the right.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			For this figure, I chose to filter out the right tail of the graph (all transactions >$20M). For some of
			these transactions, it seemed like perhaps errors had been made, either in recording the price or
			categorizing the transaction: there were rows listed as condos for as much as $300M, and when I examined
			these points on Google Maps, they seemed to be entire skyscrapers rather individual condos. If I were
			doing more official analysis with this dataset, I might make an effort to correct these issues. As it was,
			I just decided to use medians rather than averages, and to keep in mind the presence of outliers in the data.

			<br />
			<br />

			

			I also looked at how the price varied by housing type:

			<figure>
				<img class = "center-fit" src="price_prop_type.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Median price of transactions by property type.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			This follows the trend I would expect. There's only one datapoint for 2-5 family homes, so it makes sense that this is
			something of an outlier. I chose to use medians instead of averages to help with the outlier
			issue discovered in the previous figure.

			<br />
			<br />

			I also looked into the price_diff field, since I thought this might be useful in understanding the change
			in prices over time. In the process, I discovered that this field has quite a lot of null values: 23,769
			of them, or almost half the dataset. This became relevant during some of my later analysis.

			<br />
			<br />

			<h4>Temporal Distribution</h4>
			<br />

			I also wanted to examine the temporal distribution of the dataset. For this, I started with simple line charts
			to show the number of transactions over time.

			<br />
			<br />

			The first line chart shows all property types, including condos.

			<figure>
				<img class = "center-fit" src="time_all.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Number of transactions over time by property type, including all residential property types.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			Since condos completely dominate the chart above, I also made the chart with condos excluded, to better
			visualize trends among the other housing types.

			<figure>
				<img class = "center-fit" src="time_no_condo.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Number of transactions over time by property type, excluding residential condos and including all
				other residential property types.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			These graphs showed approximately what I was expecting. Data collection appears fairly consistent from
			2000 to 2022, with expected dips during the 2008 recession and 2020 pandemic.
			
			<br />
			<br />
			
			In the figure above, it's
			interesting to see that 1-family homes experience a slight rise, while 2 and 3-family homes appear to
			remain more stable. I was curious about this trend, and it led into one of my three initial questions.
			<br />
			<br />

			<hr>
			<br/>
			<h3>Trends in Buyer Type Over Time</h3>

			<br />

			I wanted to start by examining what was driving the increase in single-family home purchases, so I broke
			down these purchases by buyer type.

			<figure>
				<img class = "center-fit" src="single_family_time.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					This figure shows purchases of single-family homes over time, colored by buyer type.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			The figure above shows that purchases of single-family homes by non-investors have stayed fairly stable,
			and the rise is driven mainly by increasing purchases by investors. This was interesting to me, and I
			was then curious how this trend might play out for other housing types. I examined multi-family homes
			(2, 3, and 2-5-family homes), as well as condominiums and apartments.

			<figure>
				<img class = "center-fit" src="multi_family_time.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					This figure shows purchases of multi-family homes over time, colored by buyer type.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			The figure above shows that the trend found for single-family homes, where investors seem to be controlling an increasing
			share of the market, holds true in the market for multi-family homes as well. Additionally, for this market,
			non-investor purchases have decreased significantly since 2000. Investor purchases have made up for the
			difference. The trend appears even more drastic here than for single-family homes.

			<figure>
				<img class = "center-fit" src="condos_time.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					This figure shows purchases of condominiums over time, colored by buyer type.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			Interestingly, condos don't seem to show the same trend as single-family and multi-family homes, or at
			least not to the same extent. While the investor share of the market does appear to have risen slightly
			since 2000, the change is much less drastic. This might imply that condos are - for whatever reason -
			less appealing to investors.

			<figure>
				<img class = "center-fit" src="apartment_time.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					This figure shows purchases of apartment buildings over time, colored by buyer type.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			The market for apartments is quite different, because none of the buyers are non-investors. However,
			there does appear to be a slight trend here away from small investors toward medium and large investors.

			<br/>
			<br/>

			This is interesting in the context of the ProPublica article included with this subtheme. As the article
			discusses, many smaller landlords - who would probably be deemed small investors by this classification -
			are being bought out by larger investors, often at the expense of tenants. The change shown in this
			graph may reflect this reality.

			<br/>
			<br/>
			<hr>
			<br/>
			<h3>Relations Between Investor Types</h3>
			<br/>

			My next question had to do with the relationships between the different investor types, and what correlations
			might be found here: does being one type of investor (i.e., a count investor) increase the chance that you're
			also another type of investor?

			<br/>
			<br/>
			This first visualization shows how being a count and value investor correlates with being an LLC investor.
			<figure>
				<img class = "center-fit" src="count_value_llc.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Relationships between investor types. The table shows different intersections of count and value
				investor types. Circle size shows the number of transactions where the buyer fell into that intersection. The coloring of the
				pie charts shows what proportion of each set of transactions was made by LLC investors. The table only includes investors
				categorized as both value and count investors.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			As I would have expected, institutional investors - particularly institutional value investors - are
			more likely to be LLC investors. This lines up with the first article from the subtheme - the Homes for
			Profit analysis - which explains how LLCs allow large investors to avoid scrutiny.

			<br/>
			<br/>

			To verify that this trend held with each relationship independently, I also checked how being an LLC
			investor correlated with each other investor type.

			<br/>
			<br/>

			One important note about these charts: they're based on numbers of transactions, not raw numbers of investors.
			Since the data doesn't include identifiable investor information, I wasn't sure how else to perform this part
			of the analysis. The charts are useful in understanding how investor types generally correlate, but I'd be hesitant to
			actually use them anywhere, because it's a little misleading what they actually represent.

			<figure>
				<img class = "center-fit" src="value_llc.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Transactions broken out by value investor type, and colored by whether the investor was an LLC
				investor. Circle size does not have meaning here. This includes only housing transactions.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<figure>
				<img class = "center-fit" src="count_llc.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Transactions broken out by count investor type, and colored by whether the investor was an LLC
				investor. Circle size does not have meaning here. This includes only housing transactions.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img class = "center-fit" src="building_llc.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Transactions broken out by building/non-building investor, and colored by whether the investor was an LLC
				investor. Circle size does not have meaning here. This includes only housing transactions.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			All of these charts suggest the same thing: being a large investor (whether that's in term of count, value,
			or building size) increases the chance that an investor will be using an LLC. This offers interesting context
			for which entities are actually using LLCs.


			<br />
			<br />
			<hr>
			<br />
			<h3>Correlation of Price with Investor Activity</h3>
			<br />

			For my last question about the dataset, I was interested in exploring how investor activity actually influenced
			housing prices. First, I just graphed the median price difference percentage by investor type.

			<figure>
				<img class = "center-fit" src="price_diff_investor.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Median price difference by investor type.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			This graph was really interesting to me, because I didn't expect the value for institutional investors to be
			so low. I wanted to examine why this might be the case. First, just to check if it was some sort of issue with
			data quality, and since I knew quite a lot of the price difference values were null, I looked at what percentage
			of price difference values were null for each investor type.

			<figure>
				<img class = "center-fit" src="null_investor_type.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Proportion of null values for price difference percentage by investor type.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			However, this did not suggest why the value was so low for institutional investors, as it's pretty similar
			across investor types. The only possible outlier is for small investors, but they don't show unexpected behavior
			in the previous plot.

			<br />
			<br />

			My next hypothesis was that perhaps institutional investors tended to invest in properties with price
			differences that were lower on average. To examine this, I first looked at price differency by property type
			and property type by investor type.

			<figure>
				<img class = "center-fit" src="price_diff_property.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Median price difference by property type
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img class = "center-fit" src="proptype_investor_all.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Property type by investor type for all residential property types.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img class = "center-fit" src="proptype_investor_no_condo.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Property type by investor type for residential property types, excluding condos.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			However, this analysis did not seem to explain why price difference was so much lower for institutional
			investors. If anything, institutional investors seem to invest <em>less</em> in less-profitable housing
			types: they're less likely to sell apartments or 1-family homes, two of the less profitable categories.

			<br />
			<br />

			My next hypothesis was that perhaps institutional investors were simply flipping properties faster, allowing
			them less time to appreciate and gain value. I plotted median flip horizon by investor type to check if this
			might be the case.

			<figure>
				<img class = "center-fit" src="flip_horizon_investor.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Median flip horizon by investor type for residential property types, excluding condos.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			This does seem to explain some of the lower price difference for institutional investors! Institutional
			investors appear to be flipping properties more quickly, which may help to explain why their median price
			difference is significantly smaller than for other investors.
			
			<br />
			<br />

			Regardless, further analysis would probably help to uncover other contributors, or factors that could
			be skewing the analysis.

			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<br />

			<p>This analysis confirmed many of my expectations about the dataset, but also opened new questions
			   into the reasons behind some of the trends I found. My findings in the first two sections - that investors
			   represent an increasing proportion of buyers in the housing market, and that larger investors are more likely
			   to use LLCs - reinforced ideas from the class readings and lectures. In the third section, I was surprised to
			   find that institutional investors experienced lower price differences than other investors, and I'm still curious
			   if there are causes of this that I may be missing. While flip horizons did seem to provide one possible explanation,
			   I'd be interested in performing more analysis in the future to better understand what's going on.
