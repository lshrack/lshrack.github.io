			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

      <figure>
				<img class = "center-fit" src="sketch_1.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Sketch 1 - Line charts showing population by age, with different lines for gender and year.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Since this was my first sketch, the goal was primarily to get a feel for the data and understand what relationships a visualization should show.</li>
				<li>I wanted a visualization that allowed the viewer to see the differences in population distribution both by date and by gender.</li>
				<li>A significant flaw of this visualization is that it graphs age as though it's measured continuously, which is
					misleading, since age is actually binned by 5 year groups here.
				</li>
				<li>I think that the choice to have two different variables represented by the lines themselves - year
					and gender - makes the graph harder to interpret. Viewers have to look at both the color of the lines
					and the marking to understand which line means what. I think it's probably a better rule of thumb
					to only encode one variable in mark type/color, when possible.
				</li>
			</ul>

      <figure>
				<img class = "center-fit" src="sketch_2.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
          Sketch 2 - Population Pyramid (upside-down)
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>This sketch essentially replicates a population pyramid, though I didn't actually realize that
					until I had started drawing the sketch. It's upside-down from the standard population pyramid
					orientation, which could be misleading.
				</li>
				<li>I do like this visualization, and I can see why population pyramids are so widely used.
					It's convenient to be able to easily compare both the relative sizes and the different distributions
					of the 1900 and 2000 populations, and the split by gender doesn't add mental effort the way it does
					in my first sketch.
				</li>
				<li>Like in Sketch 1, I chose to use fairly traditional encodings for gender - blue and red - partially
					because they seemed like intuitive choices for the reader to understand, and partially because they were
					the pen colors I had on hand.
				</li>
			</ul>

      <figure>
				<img class = "center-fit" src="sketch_3.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
          Sketch 3 - Small Multiples, showing the relative population size between 1900 and 2000, split out by age group.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>This is a very poorly designed visualization, in my opinion. It's hard to interpret and misleading. The equal
					circle sizes seem to imply that the population at each age group is the same, which isn't true. The fact that
					the populations at the different years are divided into segments of circles imply that they add up to some
				meaningful whole, which also isn't true. </li>
				<li>My goal with this visualization was to show how the proportion of the population within each age range changed
					over time. I do think that the visualization captured this to some extent, though it takes some interpretation
					from the viewer to figure out what it's actually showing. With a bit of analysis, it is interesting to see how
					- for example - the number of 0-5-year-olds has only tripled from 1900 to 2000, the number of people over 90 has
					gone up by a factor of about 41.
				</li>
				<li>A main takeaway from this sketch is the importance of intuitive design. The design of this visualization is
					misleading in multiple ways, because the things one might intuitively assume to be true are not. It also makes it
					much harder to interpret the visualization.
				</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        My main takeaway from making these sketches was the importance of intuitive design. While I enjoyed thinking
		of more creative ways to represent the data, I still preferred Sketch 2 over the other two because it was
		much more readable. While not everyone has necessarily seen a population pyramid, they're designed to be
		fairly intuitive and allow multiple variables to be represented without overwhelming one another. Having two
		overlaid like this didn't seem to detract from readability, either, since all of the numbers for 1900 were
		smaller than those for 2000. However, making the other sketches did serve as an interesting way to reflect
		on different take-aways from the data. Sketch 3 - while quite flawed - did present some interesting take-aways
		on how much the makeup of society has changed since 1900.

			<h2>Phase Two: Final Design</h2>

				<figcaption>
				Final Visualization: Overlaid Population Pyramids, showing population distribution during each of the two years.

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
        For my final design, I went with a population pyramid for each year, with the 1900 one overlaid on top of the 2000
		one. While this definitely isn't the most creative design, I chose it 
		for its intuitive nature and ability to represent multiple variables - age, population,
		gender, and year - without overwhelming the viewer.
		<br />
		<br />
		My write-up intends to communicate the change in population distribution, both over age and gender, from 1900
		to 2000. The overlaid pyramid allows this comparison to be made quite easily, because for every age and gender
		bin, there are two bars that can be directly compared. Also, the pyramid shows the general 'shapes' of the population
		distributions during the two years - you can clearly see the steeper, pointier one for 1900, with more young people
		and fewer old people, as well as the more rectangular one for 2000.
		<br />
		<br />
		I tried to make design decisions that would make the visualization as readable as possible. For color, I chose to use blue and red, again because they seemed reasonably intuitive. While there
		are definitely arguments for mixing up the colors used to represent the genders, population pyramids are
		traditionally drawn in blue and pink or blue and red, so this helped make the chart easily recognizable as a
		population pyramid and thus readable at a glance. For the legend on the right, I chose to clearly label what each color represented. I was concerned that readers
		might be confused about how year was being represented (in different shades of blue and red), so I was careful
		to make this explicitly clear in the legend. I also hoped that this legend would make the chart more readable
		for anyone not familiar with population pyramids. In terms of scale, I was careful to make sure that the axes followed the same scale, so that comparisons
		could accurately be made between the two sides of the visual.
		<br />
		<br />
		A possible weakness of this visualization is the representation of the 2000 values as a lighter shade. While
		I did this because I wanted to make them different shades of blue and red, it's possible that people might
		interpret the lighter shade as meaning that these values aren't certain - for instance, that they represent
		values in the future.
		<br />
		<br />
		Phase One informed my final visualization because it allowed me to discard a couple of other visualization types
		that didn't work as well, and to finetune the population pyramid. By exploring a variety of ways of looking at the data,
		I felt more confident in my decision for Phase 2, as I didn't think the other options I'd explored really measured up.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        This visualization design process was very helpful in allowing me to approach the data in more ways than I
		would have otherwise thought of. Having to create multiple visualizations of the same small dataset made me
		think harder about all the possible ways to represent the same few datapoints. While I ended up with a fairly
		standard design, I thought it was interesting that I got there not by looking up the best way to represent
		population data, but instead through a process of trial and error: after creating my first sketch, I started
		thinking about rotating the axes 90 degrees, and then fairly naturally stumbled across the population pyramid
		design.
